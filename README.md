# DDG-CodingExercises
My C++ Implementation for the coding assignment of [this course](https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/). The skeleton of the original projects is [here](https://github.com/GeometryCollective/ddg-exercises). The projecs are stored under the ```projects``` directory.

## What I've Done
I've implemented 7 of 9 projects:
- [x] simplicial-complex-operators
- [x] discrete-exterior-calculus
- [x] discrete-curvatures-and-normals
- [x] poisson-problem
- [x] geometric-flow
- [x] parameterization
- [x] geodesic-distance
- [ ] vector-field-decomposition
- [ ] direction-field-design

## Build
To build these projects, follows the ```README.md``` under each project directory.
